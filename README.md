# Formative-Assessment-NLP---Emotion-Classification-in-Text
The objective of this project is to develop machine learning models that can classify emotions in text samples. This involves several key components, including loading and preprocessing the dataset, feature extraction, model development, and model comparison.

Key Components
1. Loading and Preprocessing

Loading the Dataset:
First we loading the dataset

Preprocessing Steps:

Text Cleaning:
This involves converting all text to lowercase to ensure uniformity, and removing punctuation and special characters which do not contribute to the emotion classification.
Tokenization: 
This process splits the text into individual words (tokens), which is essential for further text analysis.
Removal of Stopwords:
Stopwords (common words like 'and', 'the', etc.) are removed because they do not carry significant meaning for the task of emotion classification.

Impact on Model Performance:

Preprocessing improves model performance by reducing noise and ensuring that only meaningful words are considered. This leads to better feature extraction and ultimately enhances the accuracy and reliability of the models.

2. Feature Extraction
CountVectorizer vs. TfidfVectorizer:
CountVectorizer: This method converts the text data into a matrix of token counts. Each word in the text is represented as a feature, and its value is the number of times it appears in a document.
TfidfVectorizer: This method also converts text data into a matrix but uses the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) scoring. TF-IDF reflects the importance of a word in a document relative to its frequency across all documents, which helps in giving more weight to rare but significant words.

Transformation Process:
The chosen method transforms the text data into numerical features that can be used as input for machine learning models. These vectors represent the text in a high-dimensional space, where each dimension corresponds to a word or term.

3. Model Development
Naive Bayes:
Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem. It assumes that the features (words) are independent given the class (emotion). Despite this simplifying assumption, it performs well for text classification tasks.

Support Vector Machine (SVM):
SVM is a discriminative classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane which maximizes the margin between different classes in the feature space. It is effective in high-dimensional spaces and is well-suited for text classification.

4. Model Comparison
Evaluation Metrics:
Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified samples out of the total samples.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
Model Suitability:

Naive Bayes: This model is simple and fast, and it performs well with small to medium-sized datasets. It is especially effective when the features are conditionally independent.
SVM: This model is more complex and can handle large feature spaces well. It tends to perform better than Naive Bayes when there is a clear margin of separation in the data.


Conclusion
From this project , Developing machine learning models for emotion classification in text involves several critical steps. 
Proper preprocessing ensures that the text data is clean and relevant, which enhances the feature extraction process. Feature extraction using CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer converts text into numerical data, making it suitable for model training. Both Naive Bayes and SVM are powerful models for this task, with their suitability depending on the dataset characteristics and specific requirements of the task. Evaluating these models using metrics like accuracy and F1-score helps in understanding their performance and selecting the best model for deployment.
